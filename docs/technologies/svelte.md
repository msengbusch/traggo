# Svelte

Svelte is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It allows developers to write components that are compiled into highly efficient JavaScript code. Svelte focuses on minimizing the amount of code that needs to be shipped to the browser, resulting in faster load times and better performance. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and use. With its reactive approach, Svelte enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Technology Choice

1. **Performance**: Svelte's compilation process optimizes the code, resulting in faster load times and better performance compared to other frameworks.

2. **Developer Experience**: Svelte's simple and intuitive syntax makes it easy for developers to learn and use. It provides a smooth development experience with features like reactive updates and automatic DOM manipulation.

3. **Size**: Svelte's approach of compiling components into highly efficient JavaScript code helps in reducing the overall size of the application, resulting in faster downloads and improved user experience.

## Alternatives

1. **React**: As React has the biggest javascript framework the ecosystem is enormous. Unfortunatley in terms of performance (it's not that bad) is hangs behind svelte.

2. **Vue**: Vue is another big javascript framework. It improves on the DX of React, but dosen't solve the performance.

4. **Qwik**: Qwick aims to be quick. This is achieved via a new method of rendering. It uses same as React jsx to represent components.

5. **HTMX**: HTMX isn't a javascript framework in a traditional sense. It provides extensions to HTML, so that many features usally reserved for full blown js frameworks are simply available via html tags. It is used in combination with SSR.
