# Bun

Develop, test, run, and bundle JavaScript & TypeScript projectsâ€”all with Bun. Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

## Technology Choice

1. **Performance**: Bun offers an exception performance for startup and execution of any javascript code.

2. **Combination of multiple tools**: Bun combines a javascript runtime, test executor, package manager and bundler.

## Alternatives

1. **Node**: The first serverside javascript runtime. Node has npm as package manager integrated. Node and npm are both painfully slow.
2. **Deno**: Deno is from the same developer as Node. It is faster and more userfriendly then Node, but not as fast as bun.
3. **Yarn**: Yarn isn't a javascript runtime, only a package manager. It improves the performance of npm, but dosen't change the infinitly deep node_modules folder.
4. **PNPM**: PNPM is also only a package manager, but improves on the speed and size situation. If bun wasn't available PNPM would be the used option.
